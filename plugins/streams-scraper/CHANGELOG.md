## 1.0.9

- Moves the runtime to a self-contained plugin implementation instead of relying on Moviefinder's internal `lib/plugins/streams-scraper/*` imports.

- Updates desktop Real-Debrid API fallback to SDK-safe desktop command execution for external bundling.

## 1.0.8

- Keeps full stream-provider/sidebar/playback contract behavior from 1.0.7.

## 1.0.7

- Reuses the established Lumio stream sidebar/settings/playback components to avoid UI and behavior regressions.

## 1.0.6

- Rollback release: restores stable pre-separation baseline behavior.
- Keeps update path above 1.0.5 so clients can upgrade cleanly.

## 1.0.0
